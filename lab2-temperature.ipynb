The currents we will be measuring will start at a few $\\mathrm{nA}$, a million times below the range of cheap ammeters (the nice multimeters can measure this, but we don't have enough of them for every lab station).  With this connection scheme, the saturation current $I_S$ is forced to go through the $10 \\,\\mathrm{M\\Omega}$ input resistance of the oscilloscope+probe combination.
